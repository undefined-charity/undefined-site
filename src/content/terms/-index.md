# Terms & Conditions

## Community Event Standards

When you participate in Undefined events, you have rights and responsibilities that keep our community safe, welcoming, and fun for everyone. For details about how we handle personal information, please review our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

### Privacy & Photography

**Public Areas**: Standard venue privacy policies apply in all public areas and spaces not exclusively reserved for our events.

**Private Events**: We take photos and videos at our private events for use on social media, marketing, and community documentation.

**Your Right to Opt-Out**: You have the right to opt-out of photography at any time:

- Request an opt-out wristband when you enter any event
- Visit the info/registration table anytime during the event to request one
- Anyone wearing an opt-out wristband will be avoided, blurred, or excluded from photos whenever possible

**Important Notes**:

- This may not be possible for large group photos or if we can't see your wristband
- Other attendees or members of the public may take photos, which we cannot control
- Do not join group photos with the expectation that you will be blurred out - opt-out wristbands work best for candid shots and smaller groups
- If you see a photo of yourself that you wish to have removed, contact us immediately and we will take it down

**Personal Recording & Streaming**:

- Do not record audio, take video, or livestream anyone without explicit consent from every identifiable person.
- Organizers may direct you to stop recording or to delete media that violates these rules or jeopardizes participant safety.
- Media captured for personal use must still honor opt-out wristbands and any private-space restrictions explained by staff.

### Consent is Critical

Consent must be explicit, informed, and freely given every single time. It cannot be implied by past interactions, social cues, or silence. You are responsible for confirming consent before any interaction and for stopping immediately if it is revoked.

**Consent is mandatory** for all physical contact, including but not limited to:

- Touching, hugging, or any physical interaction
- Intimate contact of any kind
- Any activity involving bodily contact or physical assist

**Ask every time** – if you have not clearly heard “yes,” you do not have consent. **No means no** and “stop,” “not now,” or any expression of hesitation must be honored immediately. Pressuring someone, following them, or attempting to wear them down is unacceptable and will result in removal from the event.

### Venue Care & Respect

**Keep Our Spaces Clean**:

- Remove all trash or dispose of it in appropriate receptacles
- Leave venues as clean as or cleaner than you found them
- Help maintain the spaces that welcome our community

**Respect Property & People**:

- Do not damage or break venue property, equipment, or furnishings
- Treat venue staff, volunteers, and fellow attendees with kindness and respect
- Be considerate of noise levels and venue rules
- Follow all venue-specific guidelines and policies

**Food Safety & Wildlife Precautions**:

- Some venues (like TRC) have specific food handling and safety instructions that must always be followed
- Properly store and dispose of all food and scented items according to venue requirements
- Follow all wildlife safety protocols, including bear safety measures where applicable

### Community Safety

**If You See Something, Say Something**:

- Report any concerns, unsafe behavior, or violations to event organizers immediately
- Help us maintain a safe, welcoming environment for everyone
- We're here to make things right - don't hesitate to speak up
- All reports will be taken seriously and handled appropriately

### Participant Rights & Board Authority

Everyone has the right to enjoy Undefined programs without harassment, undue burden, or safety risks. To uphold that commitment, the Undefined board may suspend or revoke a person's ability to attend events, volunteer, or participate in any official chat groups at any time and for any reason. While the board retains absolute discretion, suspensions typically occur when an individual presents a safety risk to themselves or others, creates substantial disruption, refuses to respect consent, or otherwise places an undue burden on the community or its organizers.

The board may also bar or limit someone's participation based on credible information from other community organizations, including incidents that occurred off-site or in other spaces. Suspensions may be temporary, indefinite, or permanent and may be issued with or without prior warning. Refunds for revoked participation follow the Event Refunds policy below unless otherwise determined by the board.

### Telegram Community Conduct

Our official Telegram groups extend the same expectations set for in-person gatherings:

- Treat every member with respect—harassment, hate speech, doxxing, threats, or discriminatory language are prohibited.
- Keep chats free of spam, solicitation, or disruptive content that derails community support spaces.
- Do not share screenshots, recordings, or member information outside the group without permission.
- Moderators may delete content, mute participants, or remove members at their discretion to protect community safety.

Participation in our Telegram spaces is a privilege, not a right, and is subject to the same suspension rules outlined above.

## Event Operations

### Event Refunds

**Up to Two Weeks Before Event**:

- Full refunds will be given automatically where possible
- Processing fees are non-refundable

**Within Two Weeks of Event**:

- Refunds will be given pending our ability to resell your ticket
- Generally not an issue, but requires approval
- Processing fees are non-refundable

**No-Show Refunds**:

- Given only in extreme extenuating circumstances
- Requires approval of the board
- Documentation may be required

**Processing Fees**:

- Credit card and third-party processing fees are not refundable
- In some cases, these fees can be applied as credit toward other tickets at the same event

### Accessibility & Accommodations

We strive to make every gathering accessible. Contact us at [contact@undefined.charity](mailto:contact@undefined.charity) or note your needs during registration as early as possible—ideally two weeks before the event—so we can coordinate with venues and vendors. While we may not be able to fulfill every request, we will make good-faith efforts, communicate available options, and propose alternatives when feasible.

### Ticket Transfers & Resale

Tickets are non-transferable without prior approval from Undefined. To request a transfer, contact us with the recipient's name and contact information. Unauthorized resale, auctioning, or price markups (scalping) are prohibited and may result in ticket cancellation without refund.

### Event Changes & Force Majeure

Undefined may modify, postpone, or cancel an event due to circumstances beyond our control, including severe weather, public health guidance, venue issues, or other force majeure events. In such cases, our liability is limited to the remedies described in the Event Refunds policy unless otherwise required by law.

## Website Terms of Use

By using this website, you agree to comply with these terms and conditions. Undefined reserves the right to modify these terms at any time.

### Third-Party Links

Our website may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these external sites.

## Limitation of Liability

**Event Participation**: You participate in Undefined events at your own risk. Undefined, its board members, volunteers, and staff are not responsible for any injuries, damages, losses, or accidents that may occur during events or related activities.

**Property and Personal Items**: Undefined is not responsible for lost, stolen, or damaged personal property at events or venues.

**Third-Party Venues**: Many events are held at third-party venues. Undefined is not responsible for venue conditions, safety, or policies beyond our direct control.

**Assumption of Risk**: By attending events, you acknowledge and assume all risks associated with participation, including but not limited to physical activity, outdoor conditions, wildlife encounters, and interactions with other participants.

**Release of Claims**: To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to release and hold harmless Undefined from any and all claims, damages, or liabilities arising from your participation in events or use of our services.

**Nonprofit Status**: As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Undefined operates with limited resources and assets. This limitation of liability reflects our organizational capacity and mission-driven nature.

### Support & Educational Content

Our support groups, chat discussions, and educational workshops provide peer-led community care, not clinical therapy, medical treatment, or legal advice. Nothing shared in our programs should be interpreted as a substitute for professional services. Always seek qualified help from licensed providers for medical, mental-health, or legal needs, and contact emergency services if you or someone else is in immediate danger.

## Nonprofit Information

### 501(c)(3) Status

Undefined is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Donations may be tax-deductible to the extent allowed by law.

### Violations

Violations of our community guidelines—especially around consent, harassment, and safety—may result in immediate removal from events and indefinite suspension of your right to attend Undefined programs or participate in official chat spaces. The board may impose additional restrictions based on conduct reported by other community organizations whenever it deems necessary to protect participants.
